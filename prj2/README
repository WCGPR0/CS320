I believe my implementation of this project is slightly unique, in which I used a map or list STL container.
There are a few errors, where the generated output do not always match the correct output.

Going over the code, and through extensive debugging, the logic seems correct and I couldn't locate the logic errors.
Instead of cold-hot bits, I wasn't paying attention and made the mistake of implementing the random scheme for address replacement.
